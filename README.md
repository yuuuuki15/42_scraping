# 42_scraping
### Step1
First you need to download chromedrive to your computer

I used brew.   
`$ brew install chromedriver`

If you don't have brew, check this out!->https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

### Step2
You can change `USERNAME` , `PASSWORD` to your current login information.  
also change your path to chromedriver if it's needed.  
`driver = webdriver.Chrome('/usr/local/bin/chromedriver')	`

### Step3
Try to hit the script in the directory of this file!  
`$ python 42_scraping.py`


If you have any question, don't hesitate to ask me.
